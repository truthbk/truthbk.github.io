<p>During my stint at the <a href="http://www.hpcn.es">HPCN lab at UAM</a>, I was involved in a few projects, as well as the writeup of my master's thesis. The work stemming from these efforts resulted in a handful of publications which I make available here. I would like to thank all authors involved in these papers as they would've surely not been possible without their contributions, particularly my professors at UAM and HPCN labmates. </p>
