<p>Hey people! (You know it's funny I say hi, I don't think anybody reads this blog anyway. So this goes out to that huge void on the other end of this post.)</p>
<p>Things were looking good a month ago when I was contacted by Google for a Software Engineering position for recent grads. I was delighted quite frankly, for a kid from Madrid it sounded like a hell of an opportunity. Imagine that? Having the opportunity to have your code (I don't care if at the end of the day a single line of your code actually gets merged into production) being used by millions. You know Google is well rated in all "best workplaces" rankings, offices in NY, Mountain View..... So yeah, I was thrilled. Besides, these dudes actually do import talent, if you're the right cat they will sponsor your H1B visa. Gateway to a US job with a US salary (yeah and US taxes too, world ain't perfect).</p>
<p>Anyway, to cut the chase, I was denied, rejected, refused. So if you want a merry fairytale, read no further. Yet this is no tragedy either. I just want to share my experience, what I did and did not do. Hopefully others may benefit from it and eventually nail their interview. Now, as many of you may be aware of, Google makes candidates sign an NDA, so there are many details about the interviews I will not be able to disclose. But I don't think that matters much. As a matter of fact, if I'd tell you the questions themselves that would probably be a disservice to all of you. It is the abstract aspect of the interview which I think you should focus on when you prepare your interview. And that takes me to my first piece of advice if you <strong>really</strong> want the job: prepare for your interviews. </p>
<p>It is not in my nature to prepare for stuff like this thoroughly, and I didn't. I have the strong conviction that if the knowledge you possess on a daily basis is not enough to land the job, then you probably don't deserve it. When you cram stuff in by a deadline, it usually flushes with the same speed it was memorized. Don't get me wrong, I did dedicate a few hours to review some basic algorithms stuff (straight out of the masterpiece by CLRS: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms">Introduction to Algorithms</a>), but that was it. I mean that book is probably what, 1000 pages long? And pretty much a <em>bible</em> in the subject. So you can take my word, I probably took a quick look at 30-40 pages all in all,  and refreshed my mind with the pseudocode therein described. That was all. Did I really bother to go back to my class notes to check anything out? No. What I did do was enjoy myself with a few fun puzzle and brainteasers (you know the kind you might find if you <em>google</em> (pun intended) around for "google interview questions").... it didn't turn out to be too useful because the interview process (at least in my case: recent grads) was quite academic. That said, I do have the feeling one of the interviewers could've busted out with one of those. </p>
<p>So that was my preparation process. Slim. Now I'm an MSc. student, so a lot of the more core CS is pretty much stored deeep in my mind, or long gone, so it was probably unwise of me to not look into stuff I hadn't seen in 3/4 years. Like I said, I wanted to confront the interview with my stock knowledge (I still haven't decided if I really wanted to do that, or if I just didn't really feel like studying much after 8 hours in the lab; but the former sounds much better, no doubt), a bit revamped, but stock. Computer Science is a ridiculously vast subject, so vast I don't think anybody would ever consider it a self-contained subject. As you well know topics range from computer architecture to networking to AI to algorithms to grammars, compilers and automata to electronics to.... well you get the picture. Now, I graduated from my BSc. in 2008, so that's three years. My MSc. has been centered around embedded systems and networking, so I was quick to figure out that a whole lot of stuff was no longer in me. But with two weeks to prepare, the will to attempt to refresh and reacquire all that knowledge just wasn't in me. In hindsight I can pretty much admit that you don't need to relearn everything, not at all, but you might be in a better position to nail the interviews if you have just graduated from you BSc. in CS or if your MSc. is more directly related to the more algorithmic and "<em>theoretical</em>" aspects of CS as opposed to the architectural ones (again, for recent grads interviews).</p>
<p>What I do feel I did right was to be fairly relaxed. I mean the world will not come to an end if you're not selected. Seriously, it won't. I mean you will be put in the spotlight, and you need to be ready for that. At some point in the interview, it will be you, an empty whiteboard, a problem you need to code, a frickin' intelligent interviewer watching. So block all of that *** out, and try to focus on the problem. Easier said than done, obviously. But try to enjoy the problem and the challenge. And although I obviously was't good enough, at least I walked out of the NY offices not feeling like a total retard. I had understood every problem and was able to code solutions (surely imperfect, but close to functional) for all problems but one.... and if I wasn't able to provide an answer (this is what happened in my second interview, which was quite bad), it was solely due to the fact I was asked something I hadn't seen since I passed the pertinent subject 4 years prior to the interview. Like I said, the approach is very academic, so you may find yourself in that familiar situation when you skipped chapter 6 of the syllabus whilst studying the night before an exam.... and summoned by murphy's law, there was your Chapter 6 Question sitting on your exam, waiting to be answered......  </p>
<p>Now this brings me onto another thing I didn't do well. Whatever minor coding I did in preparation, particularly in the plane, or the afternoon before, I did on the computer. I typed it, compiled it, debugged it. Not a good idea. You will not get that opportunity with google. I don't agree with that process, but it is what it is. So practice your paper coding. As a result, I'm sure I made a few coding mistakes, maybe one off's, or forgetting a base case, or whatever. We tend to get careless and code quickly because we know we can debug it in 5 minutes in the computer. So paper coding will help you put a little more thought into loops indexes, conditions, etc.... should the condition on that <em>if</em> be a <em>||</em> or a <em>&&</em>? .... *** like that.</p>
<p>Also, if you say your preferred language is C/C++ or Java, they expect valid C or Java. But you probably won't get through the phone screening anyway if your coding isn't up to par. That said, it was my feeling they don't really care if you have total mastery of the grammar itself. I'm a C/C++ guy, and knowing the grammar well: what a <em>static</em> modifier will do to a variable or a function, what the <em>inline</em> modifier does, bit representation in structs, certain logical operators, representation of data with a union, preprocessor directives, blah blah, had absolutely no impact in the outcome of any of my interviews. I actually felt one of my interviewers kind of got irked because I was malloc'ing... In conclusion, what really is important is the algorithm itself, the bounds, complexity, etc. And obviously a process that will (roughly?) yield the correct answer.</p>
<p>Now, my interviews were all surprisingly similar between them, which was in itself surprising because the interviewers knew what had been asked before. So I kind of have the feeling these guys basically have a couple of questions before they walk in the room, as a matter of fact one of my interviewers didn't even check what the others had asked. As a result, I felt I was evaluated on the same grounds all the time. Now, to me, this process is severely flawed. With the size Google has reached, you cannot evaluate in the same way dudes that may fall into distinct products such as search, youtube, adwords, google web server, GFS, android, etc. My perception is they hope to hire multidisciplinary raw talent, it doesn't matter if you're Usain Bolt, they want a decathlete who may also do pole vault. If you are, in fact, Usain Bolt, they will get in touch with you at the finish line to hire you at some point. They obviously can't question every candidate just on their strengths, what a beautiful world that would be. But I am telling you, if they would've asked me to join their spam filter engine team (I don't even know if this team exists; Navy Seal Team Six style...) I would've said no, saving everyone time and money. If they would've said kernel work, or android, I'd say yes in a heartbeat. With that info in hand they'd be able to target and question the candidates more specifically. I mean specialization is a direct consequence of modern economies: division of labor, comparative advantage... Should this trickle down to the recruiting process in Google? Perhaps to a greater extent than it currently does.</p>
<p>At this point I think I should give some sort of anonymous shout-out to my second telephone interviewer. His name was Phil. Now, in hindsight it feels like he conducted the interview in a fairly ideal fashion. He himself seemed extremely relaxed and laid back, something which ended up transpiring and making the interview a little easier on the candidate. The sort of questions he asked were not very different from those asked by my first interviewer, but he seemed a lot less robotic through-out the process. It really felt interactive, and to a certain extent the interview seemed quite a bit <em>organic</em>, in the sense that my answers to his questions, and the code he was seeing on his end, were shaping the direction in which the interview was going. Also the problem he proposed was a little more open-ended. Obviously not all solutions are created equal and some are better than others.... but maybe, just maybe, if your solution is suboptimal in some aspect but you can argue well why you went down a particular road, you might prove yourself just fine. For instance, maybe you've been working on embedded systems (mobile phones, perhaps?), with little memory but decent processing, and you choose an algorithm which has a reduced performance in favor of a smaller memory footprint. If you make your case, and the other side seems to be willing to listen, then you might be fine. So, since I have to send this to Google to ensure I'm not violating any NDA related policies, I'd just like them to know that Phil deserves a pat in the back. He was kind and friendly, his interview question was a little more open then just a question out of LCRS, and although it put you on the spot a little bit, I believe it actually helped reflect the sort of thought process one would go through when solving a problem. You know, not the type of question you could <em>google</em> for an answer trivially. You go Phil! ;)</p>
<p>Now, you may not want to take my word for it as Google believes I'm not fit for the position, but I promise to you, and I'm trying to be as objective as possible, the questions did not seem UberComplicated to me. I mean they're not unsolvable whatsoever, you may well be able to provide the skeleton to a working solution (surely the efficiency of the solutions, or the lack of errors or glitches in the code is how they separate truly intelligent and apt candidates from useless ones like myself?). Most of you that do pass the screening would be able to come up with a working answer within 45 minutes (the time allotted for each interview) from the comfort of your home, keyboard and perhaps a couple google queries. So I don't think you should feel tremendously scared about the difficulty of the questions themselves. What is more complicated is being able to answer the question, and have a deep understanding of the solution you provide. I feel it's not enough if you provide an answer that 'just works', you need to be in touch with how it works, the runtime, complexity, memory consumption, possible alternatives. You should know these things, because at a point you will be asked about possible problems or flaws of your working solution, and a next best alternative, etc. Some of these things you can memorize or work on, like algorithm complexities... Hash Table: O(1), BST: O(log n) on average and O(n) for the worst case, etc... But don't be like me, be smart, and refresh how algorithm complexities are calculated (ie. 2 nested fors, n^2...).  </p>
<p>Are they <strong>really</strong> tough with the evaluation? Well truth be said, I don't know. They don't share specific details about the feedback they get from each interviewer with the candidate so I don't know how pathetic I was or not. From my personal judgement and feelings, is they are reasonably tough, and their standards are quite high. What does that mean? Well if you nail two interviews, and mess up in another two. That's not good enough. If my interviews had been exams, Like I said before, I felt like I passed three of them and flunked one. And I'm not in, so that doesn't quite seem like acceptable either. My recruiter suggested that if three went real well, then I still had chances (she actually used the word 'real', so just well wouldn't be good enough either). So to me it seems like those are their standards. And this method will ensure they get all the raw, dedicated talent they need. What most saddens me is that on the interview I did worst, while the interviewer was explaining the solution, he himself stalled for like 10 minutes; at a point he couldn't come up with the answer. Being the extremely intelligent person he was (I'm totally serious about this, no sarcasm here), he eventually remembered or worked himself around the hiccup, and explained the answer to me quite well (something I thank him for, cause I will now never forget). And why does it sadden me? Well, because if the interviewer can have a bad day, or a bad moment, not be on top of his game for 10 minutes on a question he <strong>knows</strong>. Shouldn't it be acceptable for the candidate to perhaps trip up quite badly on one of the interviews? Now I'm not saying I'm not in solely cause of this interview (I made some other mistakes, some I'm aware off, some probably not), but I'm sure it hurt my chances quite badly. </p>
<p>Let me tell you briefly about the experience. It was truly outstanding, I was being flown from Spain to NYC so they obviously weren't going to fly me business class, and I hate airplanes so that was the only tough part: the flights. But oh man! They booked a reservation for me at the Standard Hotel (Google will reimburse me), I had a ridiculous room on floor 17 with views of the Hudson river. When I arrived, Sunday 26th of June, it was the gay parade, and they had just finished passing the law legalizing gay marriage in the state of NY, so the city was just crazy. I mean nuts. Music all over, people all over the streets. So that was fun to see. Anyway, the hotel is a 5 minute walk (tops) from the Google offices, so that was great as well, there was no need to stress out about getting late to the interview or missing the subway train. The offices are amazing, probably more impressive than the pictures circulating around the net. Decoration and such is quite industrial looking, which is very fit for NYC, but clean and modern. Meeting rooms are decorated after neighborhoods in the city, and yes, there is a huge playroom. There are several cafeterias all over the office because the building is just so huge (second largest footprint in NYC, and Google just finished acquiring the building so they plan to eventually occupy the whole thing). I had two interviews before lunch, and two after. In the middle I had lunch with a very nice guy who was quite keen to tell me all about the company and answer any questions I could have. Now this part is supposed to be time for you, and unevaluated. I was totally relaxed, but it's probably smart to just stay on your toes a little bit and not ask stupid ***. Yes, I admit it, I asked about the work schedule, and if working from home was a possibility. Maybe that was stupid on my part.</p>
<p>Now, I love google, I really hold no grudges whatsoever and their contributions to the digital society are countless. But I want to express some disappointment with the fact that a personal interview was not conducted at any point. I'm not sure if this is normal or not.... but seriously? You might have an IQ of 161 (Einstein in the house), but you might also be a nuthead, perhaps a psychopath: Hans Reiser style (ok, he could be innocent, maybe, so I hope nobody feels offended, was just trying to be a little comical....). Maybe you have a character which would truly benefit the atmosphere at the office...  But, can you feel me? Even if you don't give a flying hummingbird about the actual character of the candidate, conduct the interview just for image purposes, otherwise you may eventually come across as (and possibly become) a rather mechanic, synthetic, corporation. That said, and I want to stress this, underline it, put it on <strong>bold</strong> letters: most of the people (there may be some exception) I met at Google, the recruiters, engineers who interviewed me, front desk, practically everyone was friendly and open, mellow, quite laid back, etc. I mean, I was under stress, I didn't make it and despite all that, I really can't be too negative about anything in this experience.</p>
<p>Sorry for boring you with all that, at this point all I can do is thank Google for the experience and opportunity apologize for consuming their time and resources as a candidate who ended up not living up to the expectations. I feel like apologizing because I probably should've taken/invested more time to prepare given that they were flying me to NYC (capital of the world) from Madrid, into a goodass hotel for three days, etc. But what can I say? I'm like this: stubborn, and chilled. And when I say I believe interviews should verify candidate <em>integrated knowledge</em> (or what they know any day of the week on any given week of the year) as opposed to how well he/she prepared for the interview, it's because I do. I live by that, and I happily have died by that in this Google interview process. </p>
<p>Thank you for reading, and I wish you all the best in your Google interview. Go nail that sucka! ;)</p>
