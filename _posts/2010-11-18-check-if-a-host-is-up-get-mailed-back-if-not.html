<p>I was well aware that my ignorance of python was nothing to be proud of, so I've set my mind to actually get a little more proficient in it. I'm basically starting off by writing some scripts I wanted to get ready and rather than doing then in good old bash scripting, I decided to head right into python territory. I did make a bold choice by developing these scripts for python 3.1, rather than the more widespread 2.7. I figured it made sense to learn the latest release, I mean python3k will eventually be the standard I guess. Either way, the differences are quite minuscule, so there's nothing to worry about out, it's quite straightforward to migrate a script back and forth. Fortunately the python learning curve isn't too steep, or so I've heard.... and my early experience with it seems to corroborate this. If you know some scripting, Java/C++.... writing decent modular python code seems quite accessible. Now don't get me wrong, there may well be a lot of <em>crap</em> in these scripts, bear in mind I am a python newbie :)<br /></p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to write a script which would enable me to check if a host was up, and if that wasn't the case, it would send me an email to inform of the <em>down</em> status of the machine. The script isn't completely finished, because I would also like to check if the webserver is up, rather than the actual machine. Currently we just ping a url, and parse the output to decide if the machine is up or not. I will soon update the script to include an option, which will check (using the python libraries available for this task, we could also use wget, but there's no reason to do so). This way we will also know the actual webserver daemon status.</p>

<p>As you can see I've tried to keep my code as modular as possible. Hopefully this will make me write less code eventually, when I find myself reusing some of these python classes. I know, it's not necessary to wrap these things, the python smtplib is actually really straightforward and very intuitive, probably more so than my own wrapper, but I must admit that sometimes when you develop a wrapper you end up having an object which you are more familiar with, as well as breaking down the elements of the actual library you're using, thus gaining a better understanding. As I said, I am using this as an excercise to learn python, so the more code I wrote, and attempting to use good-practice rules, the better. If there's anything horrible here, please let me know! :P</p>
