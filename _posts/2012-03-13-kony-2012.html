<p>This will be probably my first and last post dealing with social issues, and the like, because this is probably not the place or time for them. But given the immense success and the huge amount of opinion and criticism it has generated, I felt compelled to give my take on the KONY 2012 video. It somehow stays relevant to the blog (barely) because it has become one of the most successful stories in terms of viral information delivery of all time. Social media has changed the game, and with it has come the possibility to create a huge impact stemming from a comparably minute source. This kind of media has the intrinsic characteristic of being potentially unreliable, manipulative, etc. I don't think this is the case with the KONY 2012 Invisible Children video, and here's why.   </p>
<p>Uhmmm, where do I start? There's been a shitload of buzz generated over this KONY 2012 video, which I fully support, and I've also read a lot of criticism. Maybe I should stay mute cause what I think or feel isn't worth much, but you know me, IJDGAF.</p>
<p>I've read arguments about the long term futility of the viral video, or how this is too narrowly focused given the never ending list of perils that desolate the African people. I've read criticism towards the American society and how "they" (we)  depict this whole complex issue into a simplified Hollywoodian plot. I've read opinions claiming this video derails ongoing positive negotiations, and how it shifts attention from more serious problems in Africa like drought, famine, malaria or AIDS. There's a lot that has been said about this effort by pundits and strategists, some with a very somber perspective....</p>
<p>It is not my intention to judge these people. They are, possibly, way more clever and prepared than I am to make any sort of evaluation, however I do think that the only important point here is morality. Obviously KONY 2012 is an act of propaganda. They are harnessing the power of social media to flood our news feeds, our twitter updates, and ultimately our brains with a cry for help on a severe issue. They're doing so with a simplified message. They're using powerful imagery, etc. It has all the symptoms of propaganda, because it is. But that's cool because the cause is just. As simple as that. This guy is scum and should be brought to justice. He is not the only guy that should be brought to justice in Africa or the world, but that is beyond the point. He belongs, at the very least, in a cell for the rest of his existence, and lobbying for this to happen, and doing so with this force should never be destructively criticized. Perhaps things may be done better, perhaps there are other ways. Whichever way, it is our choice as individuals to decide what to do with the information/propaganda provided. Some will argue that propaganda is always polarized. That doesn't matter when the issue at hand is so blatantly morally clear there is not much room for manipulation anyway. </p>
<p>I'm pretty much a cynic most of my days, but I'm also a firm believer that when a message is as clearly and morally sound as this one then pushing for it cannot be detrimental to any other cause. Of course we need to solve the problem of drought, famine, illnesses, education, increasing technological gap, etc in Africa. And we all know that Joseph Kony is not the first or last of Africa's problems. That doesn't matter, it is a problem nonetheless and must be confronted. It's not just about Kony, it's also about Vincent Otti, or Okhot Odiambo, or any war lord for that matter. Problems need to be addressed, and they need not be handled one at a time. I'm not saying the video, or Invisible Children is perfect. I don't even know how they handle donations, etc. That doesn't matter. All that matters is that we now know, and we can raise our voices for justice. And if we don't, our conscience knows. And if this doesn't bring a sense of urgency about helping Africa (and don't just stop there), then what are we worth?</p>
<p>Sadly, 99% of the senate or congress (of any country) had no idea who Joseph Kony was before this video. They know now, and that can't be a bad thing.</p>
<p>Sorry for this rant.   </p>
