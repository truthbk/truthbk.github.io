<p>Alright, please forgive me for digressing a little bit from the usual technical posts. The current tech and mobile ecosystems are experimenting an interesting transition which has made me reflect a little bit on the business side of things. I absolutely do <b>not</b> consider myself to be particularly business savvy, this is simply an opinion prompted by some recent announcements and articles I've read. Let me get started.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for RIM, their market share (and value) has plummeted in the past few years. It all slowly began when Apple introduced the game changing iPhone. The Blackberry until then, had been a great mobile phone with superior messaging capabilities thanks to RIM's BB Messenger service and corporate email. But the moment the iPhone changed the landscape of mobililty for good, the blackberry became immediately obsolete. OK, maybe not obsolete, but just not up to par in anything that wasn't messaging. RIM was in trouble, but they stil felt had a cheaper handheld device with plenty to offer. Unfortunately for RIM, the scenario was about to get a lot more dire for them. Google steps up to the plate and delivers with Android. Now the two biggest and best innovators in technology are neck deep and full-streams ahead in the mobility sector. Apple, the powerhouse and leading brand for product engineering, and Google, the most technically gifted company on the planet and undisputed kings of software, now have about 70% of US market share between the two (earned in about 5 years). Could it get worse? It did.<br />
<!--more--><br />
Both Apple and Google not only created devices and their OS's but also opened the door to third party app developers with their excellent framework (this is actually at the core of RIM's problems). So up steps a startup, WhatsApp, which delivers cross-platform messaging for iPhone, Android, Blackberry. All of a sudden, "exclusive" BBM was actually leaving BB users stranded, and many of them were turning to whatsapp (or other messaging platforms) to interact with their buddies. This was a turning point for RIM, their users no longer relied or required BBM to interact with their acquaintances. At this stage, which is pretty much the stage we're at today I think we can sum it up as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>RIM does not have the best OS in mobility.</li>
<li>RIM does not have the best handheld in mobility.</li>
<li>RIM does not have the best framework for third-party apps in mobility.</li>
<li>RIM no longer has the upper hand in messaging. They may still have the best service though.</li>
</ul>
<p>As it turns out, RIM's still very relevant in the corporate/enterprise market. Since its strengths fit in particularly well with corporate requirements its presence is still relatively strong there. However, the end user demands a whole lot more from a device. RIM needs to increase the appeal of its devices for the average end-user. I know they're trying damn hard, they hired genius Dave Balmer, who has behind palm's webOS. After reading Dave's motivations and thoughts regarding his <a href="http://davebalmer.wordpress.com/2012/06/17/leaving-webos-but-not-the-web/">move</a> to RIM. I feel that although he may be right and neither Google or Apple are doing everything right, the truth is that at this stage this is irrelevant. The plethora of apps and developers for either platform is just way too large. Developers have got their hands full with iOS and Android development to make BB and a potential new BB framework their priority, much less make it the cornerstone market for their developments. Even Microsoft, who rely on .NET are struggling seriously to generate interest (go ask Nokia). The Microsoft/Nokia is actually a great example, they released a great phone in the Lumia 800+, and even an outstanding product (and relatively cheap too!) like that is just unable to generate enough buzz...</p>
<p>So what can RIM do? Well they can do one of two things. They can attempt to change the game, and dedicate their every resource to do so, or they can accept defeat in battle and try to remain in the fight. Needless to say that changing the game is not something you can just will yourself to. You need talent, you need vision, and maybe most of all, you need luck. If on the other hand they accept defeat, they may never regain the glory of old, but they may get a better share of the market than they currently have. If RIM were mine I'd go for the latter option. Microsoft on the other hand is trying really hard to accomplish the former. This <a href="http://erratasec.blogspot.com/2012/06/microsoft-surface-because-ipad-is.html">great article</a> by Bob Graham describes (and I totally agree with his point of view), how Microsoft has recognized it is also losing its battle with Apple and Google, and is going to great lengths to remain a force. They changed gaming with the Kinect. THAT was a game changer. They're now trying to compete toe-to-toe with Apple's iPad while re-establishing street cred for the brand. Microsoft is going for bust. But then again RIM is <b>not</b> Microsoft. RIM does not have the cash, or size to go down this road with such vehemence. And RIM, being in just one market (unlike microsoft who's got its tentacles not just in different markets, but also different industries) cannot afford a failure; that would mean its death. </p>
<p>This is what I'd do to save RIM. I'd look at my DNA as a company, and look at who's market I could dent if I garnered a decent alliance. RIM's DNA is not that of a software company: RIM should not continue pursuing their own OS (definitely not now), and battling in an arena where they are nowhere strong enough (with all due respect). This takes me to my first point: <b>RIM should adopt Andoroid</b>, at least in selected devices. This would allow them to allocate more resources to service development and delivery and use the already strong framework and userbase for Android.<br />
It is undeniable that RIM's added value stemmed from their messaging platform. And they should keep that somehow at the center of their business model. As such, RIM could ultimately include some sort of hardware-based (if they're real paranoid about keeping BBM closed) encryption/authentication to only allow BB branded phones (running Android or not) onto their BBM network, or they could opt to open the service up (perhaps for a fee, perhaps trying to capitalize some other way. Google would love this). Finally, whose market cap should they seek? Definitely Samsung's. That's who they're competing with. RIM must forget all about Apple. Must stop seeing an enemy in Google, and should attempt to become the best selling Android phone while keeping its messaging platform at the core of its product. Honestly, if RIM comes up with an outstanding, powerful and sleek Android phone they would definitely turn some heads. I truly feel an android-based Blackberry lineup featuring top notch features and design and most definitely slide-out keyboards in several models could make them the leading android phone brand.</p>
<p>Just my opinion. ;)</p>
