<p>Although a rare occurrence, it may happen, while attempting to jailbreak your phone, that you end up stuck in a infinite reboot loop after restoring your custom firmware to your phone. This obviously poses a bit of a problem because you will end up unable to enter DFU mode (also known as recovery mode) on your iPhone via the usual process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold Power + Home Button for 10 seconds</li>
<li>Release Power button, and keep holding the Home button for another 10 seconds</li>
</ol>
<p>The above might not work, and you will simply turn off your phone after <strong>step 1</strong>.</p>
<p>if this happens what you need to do is quite straightforward:<br />
<!--more--></p>
<ol>
<li>Turn your iPhone off. You might need to hold the Home + Power buttons for about 10 seconds to achieve this.</li>
<li>Make sure your iPhone is unplugged from the USB port in your computer.</li>
<li>Now that your phone is off, hold the Home button.</li>
<li>Reconnect your phone to USB port. It should now turn on. Do <strong>NOT</strong> release the Home button.</li>
<li>Be patient and hold the Home button while the phone boots up, it should eventually enter DFU mode.</li>
</ol>
<p>The above has saved me a couple of times. Don't despair, I hope this also works for you.</p>
