<p>Hi again! OK, I grew tired of having to deal with updating and upgrading wordpress. Wordpress is awesome, I've been using it for ages now, and if I stuck to it for so long it's because it delivered satisfactorily. But I just grew tired of having to deal with so much crap related to security issues, there was overhead of stuff I didn't really need, and all that.... So I just figured I was better off removing an attack vector from my VPS and just leave it as a dev machine. I had also heard a few things about how great jekyll was. I just think it's ideal for blogging: mainly static content served in a static way. It just makes sense to remove the overhead of a DB and what not, when all you really serve are code snippets and random musings. I also like the idea of being more efficient, I don't like wasting cycles and memory on a machine I own, or on any machine for that matter. So just serving content statically seems reasonable for my use-case. I was too lazy and inconsistent to actually deal with comments on wordpress anyway... and if I decide I do want to enable comments eventually, I can do that with Jekyll too (using Poole or something similar). Anyway, the bottomline is that this will soon be place where I begin posting again. I have been real lazy for almost a couple of years, and I feel like it's time to talk about some cool shit, and some broken shit and its fixes (mainly arising from my personal projects). And that brings me back to another reason why I made the move: writing posts is now so easy. I just whip out vim, or any text editor, type my nonesense and push to a github repo. That's all. And that's sweet.  
</p>
<p>Please bear with me as I fix broken links, style, appearance, etc. Hope to have this looking good soon! ;)</p>
