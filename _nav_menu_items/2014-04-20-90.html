<p>What up!? Welcome to my blog, mosts posts will revolve around my personal interests, that is: technology (linux and unix, hardware, networking, high performance computing, computer vision, upcoming trends and innovation, etc), modern arts (photography, and movies),  music, science and mathematics. </p>
<p>Anyway, I don’t feel I am a definitive source of information, I just want to share problems I encounter, my solution to some of these problems, some of my code, my opinion with regard to certain issues, etc. Hopefully, if I struggle with something and eventually get around to solving it, that can save others a whole lot of time and trouble. You know how it is with blogs, sometimes I will simply talk about my particular opinion or perspective with respect to something…. sometimes I might get a little personal, or emotional… you may agree, you may not, but you know it’s all good we can all still get along!!! :-)     </p>
<p>I am a Computer Engineer out of Universidad Autononoma de Madrid (UAM), and currently enrolled in their MSc. program in Computer and Electrical Engineering and working as a research assistant at the High Performance Computing and Networking research group. My particular research interests regard OS and driver optimization (linux), NUMA architectures, network protocols and hardware.</p>
<p>Anyway, love you all and peace!</p>
